### Abstract
* In this paper, to improve the slow processing speed of the rule-based visible and NIR (near-infrared) image synthesis method, we present a fast image fusion method using DenseFuse, one of the CNN (convolutional neural network)-based image synthesis methods. The proposed method applies a raster scan algorithm to secure visible and NIR datasets for effective learning and presents a dataset classification method using luminance and variance. Additionally, in this paper, a method for synthesizing a feature map in a fusion layer is presented and compared with the method for synthesizing a feature map in other fusion layers. The proposed method learns the superior image quality of the rule-based image synthesis method and shows a clear synthesized image with better visibility than other existing learning-based image synthesis methods. Compared with the rule-based image synthesis method used as the target image, the proposed method has an advantage in processing speed by reducing the processing time to three times or more.
